# Matplotlib-Challenge

In this project, I analyzed cancer fighting drug treatments based on a study done on mice with tumors. To start, I was given two sets of data with information such as tumor volume, timepoints, mice weight, mice gender, drug regimen, and other informative sets of data that helped this analysis. For this analysis, I mainly used pandas and matplotlib on jupyter notebook to produce my results. 

Anyone who wants to look at my results and code can find it in the Pymaceuticals_Analysis file located in the Data-Visualization folder. The data sets I analyzed are found in the Data folder inside of the Data-Visualization folder.

This project is important because it showcases my skill in data visualization using pandas and matplotlib.
